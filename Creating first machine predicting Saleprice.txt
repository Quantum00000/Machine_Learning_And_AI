Step1-Specify prediction target

#Importing pandas 
import panda as pd
# Path of the file to read
iowa_file_path = '../input/home-data-for-ml-course/train.csv'
#Optional
#Now we will printout columns to select what i want to select as target
home_data.columns

#Now saving the column into a variable Y which is our target column(It means by this we will predict other column/data)
y=home_data['SalePrice']


Step2-Create X *Data variable of columns in which u have to predict data*

#Now to be more specific about the columns in which we have to predict, we are creating a list having those selected columns
feature_names = ['LotArea',
'YearBuilt',
'1stFlrSF',
'2ndFlrSF',
'FullBath',
'BedroomAbvGr',
'TotRmsAbvGrd']

# now add the data into a variable X of all those columns
X = home_data[feature_names]

Step3- Speficy and fit the data
*DecisionTreeRegressor is a Supervised Machine learning algorith used to predict continuous numerical data*

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
iowa_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)
**Now fit the model**
iowa_model.fit(X, y)

Step4- Now predict

predictions =iowa_model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
